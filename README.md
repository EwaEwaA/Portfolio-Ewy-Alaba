# About me
 I am an ambitious person. I am determined to have a job both interesting and giving me a possibility to develop. I have always liked learning new things so IT is a natural choice as a professional area. Being a tester enables me to be up-to-date with new technologies that we can encounter everywhere, therefore, one year ago I chose a testing career and I don’t regret it.

I like to be the best at what I do. Application development process requires automation so I would like to pursue an automation tester career path. I am a self-motivated person. Therefore, I have started learning Java. Using Selenium is the next step to master on my checklist. 
I am a communicative person and I enjoy cooperating with people. That’s why I can train people in testing area in the future.
